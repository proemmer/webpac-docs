# webpac Documentation

Webpac is an web-interface for accessing Step7 plc's. This interface gave you the opportunity to read and write data over the web to and from a plc.
Furthermore it supports the functionality to subscribe to a SignalR callback to get informed if data changed.


All this could be done by address access, but webpac also supports symbolic access.
