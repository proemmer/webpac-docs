For this, you have to create a \r\ndata-mapping file. The structure of this file is an C# class with properties. \r\nTo create such a file very easy, you could use a tool from \r\n[insite-gmbh](http://www.insite-gmbh.de) called AWLConverter. \r\nThis tool extracts the data from the SimaticManager and convert it \r\nto the representation we use. \r\n\r\n![System Overview](https://github.com/proemmer/webpac-docs/blob/master/images/ToolChain.PNG)\r\n\r\n##Used Libraries\r\n\r\nTo get the plc access we use two libraries.\r\n\r\n### Dacs7\r\n\r\n[DacS7](http://proemmer.github.io/dacs7/) is a low level component which handles the communication to the \r\nplc and is available as a [nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Dacs7/) package.\r\n\r\n###Papper\r\n\r\n[Papper](http://proemmer.github.io/papper) is a data mapper which maps a c# class to a plc data block.\r\nThis package is also available as a [nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Papper/) package.\r\n\r\n",
